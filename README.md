Prusa MK3S test pattens
=======================

A word on the project
---------------------

This repository is dedicated to the creation of test patterns for the _Prusa_
MK3S 3D printer.
Its goal is to allow people to test their printer with various shapes and various
types of filament. This way, calibration with material that are not PLA would be
easier/faster.
